You don't really want to modify this dataset because you might be using it for other analyses. For example, we're going to be analyzing access to high-speed internet in a state of your choosing but next week you might want to run the same analysis on another state or maybe just on a specific county. To make sure you can **reuse** your data and code later let's create an _analytical file_ or a _working dataset_, a dataset that contains only the data needed for **this** specific analysis at hand."
